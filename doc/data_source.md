# 1. Overview

In order to make the scenarios as close to real use cases as possible, this framework also provides some source data from actual resources. Below are some real data sources that we can use in this framework.

# 2. Weather Sensor Telemetry Data

This data source represents the data reading of IoT devices that contain various types of sensors for a specific range of time (e.g. 1 week). The available **Sensor Types** are listed as below.
